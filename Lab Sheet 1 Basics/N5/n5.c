/*
Write a program that reads an integer value, num, and determines if it is a perfect square.
If it is a perfect square, then the program displays a message saying that num is a perfect
square. Note: A perfect square is a number whose square root is an integer, e.g. 4 and 25 are
perfect squares while 3 and 8 are not.
